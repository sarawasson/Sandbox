        <h3>GCSE and A-level English Language and English Literature tutoring </h3>
<p>I support GCSE and A-level English Language or Literature students who want to improve their grades, build confidence, or develop stronger analytical and writing skills. </p>
<p>I support students across all major exam boards—AQA, Edexcel, OCR, and WJEC/Eduqas—for both GCSE English Language and English Literature, understanding the specific approaches each board takes to assessment and the distinct requirements for success.</p>
<p>Each lesson focuses on building specific skills through guided practice. We might analyse a poem together, work on essay structure, or develop exam techniques. I adapt my approach to each student’s individual needs, to build their skills in a supportive and encouraging way. </p> </div>

        <h3>English Language tutoring: intermediate and advanced, IELTS preparation, and Business English </h3>
        <p>I am also a CELTA-qualified English language teacher, specialising in supporting intermediate to advanced learners of English. I also support IELTS candidates preparing for university entry, and learners of Business English for career advancement. </p>
<p>I incorporate communicative teaching methods, focusing on real-world application and fluency development. IELTS preparation includes targeted practice for all four skills (reading, writing, listening, speaking) with mock tests and feedback. Students complete practice tests independently using recommended resources, then we analyse results and focus on improvement areas during our sessions.
